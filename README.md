# Student--grades
A program that outputs a histogram of student grades for an assignment. The program should input each studentâ€™s grade as an integer and store the grade in a vector (covered in Chapter 8). Grades should be entered until the user enters -1 for a grade. The program should then scan through the vector and compute the histogram. In computing the histogram, the minimum value of a grade is 0 but your program should determine the maximum value entered by the user. Use a dynamic array to store the histogram. Output the histogram to the console. For example, if the input is: 20 30 4 20 30 30 -1 Then the output should be: Number of 4's: 1 Number of 20's: 2 Number of 30's: 3 Programming Projects 539
